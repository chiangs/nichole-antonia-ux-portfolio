title: Introduction
body: I am a UX designer in Stavanger, Norway. I have spent the last five years dedicating
  myself to the care of premature and sick infants in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit.
  This work has helped me to develop a deep sense of empathy and understanding of
  people. I am working to make user-friendly and delightful start-to-end solutions
  that makes a difference for both the end-user and the customer.
