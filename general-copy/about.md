  Title: UX Designer with a background in Healthcare

  I have spent the last 5 years dedicating myself to the care of premature and sick infants in newborn intensive care units. This work has helped me develop a great sense of empathy and understanding of people.

  I am working to make user-friendly and desirable start-to-end solutions that makes a difference for both the costumer and the end user.
