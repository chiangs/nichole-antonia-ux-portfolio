Since January 2021 I have worked as a design Intern with Laerdal Medical. At Laerdal I have gotten the amazing opportunity to combine my clinical experience with my design skills. I am currently working on a very exciting project where **we help save more infantsâ€™ lives through design**.



Some of the experiences that have shaped me as a person are my **volunteer time in China** and my work as a **social manager and medical supervisor in Sri Lanka**. During my time in Sri Lanka, I facilitated up to 100 young volunteers at a time. I introduced them to Sri Lankan culture and familiarized them with their projects. I held medical camps and medical teaching sessions. I love learning but I also love teaching. All of my many passions and capabilities make me not only a good UX designer but also a great coworker.
