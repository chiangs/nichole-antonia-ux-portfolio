After 6 exciting years in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU), I decided it was time to pursue a **new career**. I love working with people but I have also always loved being **creative and solving problems** and that is where UXD came into the picture.



In March 2021 I graduated from the **User Experience Programme** at Noroff University College, where I was challenged to learn and develop my skills and knowledge-base rapidly during my studies. It required a lot of hands-on work; conducting user interviews and usability testing, for example. So far I find myself especially passionate about _user research_ but I get just as caught up and excited when working on the nitty-gritty during the wireframing process.



During my time with Noroff, my tutors have praised my diligence and competencies and I have been selected to **mentor newer students** and guide them through their studies.
