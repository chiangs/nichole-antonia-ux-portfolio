After 6 exciting years in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit, I decided it was time to pursue a **new career**. I obviously love working with people but I have also always loved being **creative and solving problems** and that is where UXD came into the picture.



In March 2021 I graduated from the **User Experience Programme** at Noroff University College. I have learned and developed my skills rapidly during my studies. I have done a lot of hands-on work, for example, conducting user interviews and usability testing. So far I find myself passionate about user research but somehow I get just as caught up and excited when working on the nitty-gritty during the wireframing process.



During my time with Noroff my tutors have praised my diligence and competencies and I have been selected to **mentor newer students** and guide them through their studies.
